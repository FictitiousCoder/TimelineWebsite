                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the first The Legend of Zelda game released for the Nintendo 64, is the fifth installment in The Legend of Zelda, and was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age. It is also listed by numerous websites and magazines among the greatest video games ever created. Released in the United States on November 23, 1998, it was the first game in The Legend of Zelda series that was visually displayed in 3D (previous games of the series had a front or top-down view).
                <br><br>
                It is generally considered to be a classic, most famously scoring the first ever perfect 40/40 in Famitsu Magazine - a feat which only twenty three games (including The Wind Waker and Skyward Sword) have ever achieved. In addition, G4 television declared it "the #1 game of all time" as well as Nintendo Power. Ocarina of Time is listed in Guinness World Records - Gamer's Edition 2008, as the highest ranked game of all time. In the 2010 Gamer's Edition, Ocarina of Time was updated as "the most critically acclaimed game of all time." It is also the highest scoring game of all time on Metacritic, at 99/100.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is the sixth game in The Legend of Zelda series and was released on the Nintendo 64 in 2000. Unique among the Zelda series, the game included a 3-day time system (72 hours in total). Majora's Mask is one of the few Zelda games that Ganon does not play any role whatsoever. Princess Zelda is only seen once in a flashback scene.
                <br><br>    
                Majora's Mask is the sequel to the popular first 3D Zelda game, Ocarina of Time, and uses the same engine, as well as many art resources. Many of the conventions pioneered in Ocarina of Time are present in Majora's Mask, including characters, enemies, and items.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker is the tenth installment of the Zelda series. It is the first Zelda game for the Nintendo GameCube, and was released in Japan on December 13, 2002, in Canada and the United States on March 24, 2003, in South Korea on April 16, 2003, in Europe on May 3, 2003 and in Australia on May 7, 2003.
                <br><br>    
                The Wind Waker is notable for being the first game in the series to employ cel-shading, a lighting and texturing technique that results in the game having a cartoon-like appearance. It also differentiates itself from other Zelda games with its massive overworld, the Great Sea (which may be the largest overworld of any Zelda game), which must be explored using a boat, the King of Red Lions. It is an indirect sequel to Ocarina of Time, taking place several hundred years after the events of the previous games.
                <br><br>
                Although the sea-faring gameplay and cartoon-like graphics were a point of critique for some, The Wind Waker was in the end the fourth best-selling GameCube game of all time. However, it should be noted that pre-orders of the game were significantly boosted by the inclusion of a pre-order bonus disc, which features Ocarina of Time and Master Quest. Master Quest is an altered port of the original Ocarina game, with partially re-designed, more difficult dungeons.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was the last GameCube The Legend of Zelda game and the first Wii Zelda game. It was highly anticipated by many members of the gaming community, and was regarded as finally fulfilling the dreams of those who wanted a much more realistic and mature Zelda game, as seen in the SpaceWorld 2000 GameCube Tech Demo. This is the first Zelda game to be rated T by ESRB and 12+ by PEGI. The reason is probably because of violence, blood (as seen when Link strikes Dark Beast Ganon; it drips when he runs around, and also when a Deku Baba is defeated), and signs of nudity (as shown by the Great Fairy). This game is also notable for being the first console Zelda title released in the United States before Japan, as the Wii version was released in America on November 19, 2006, whereas the Japanese versions were released on December 2. Because of this, Twilight Princess was one of the launch titles for the Wii alongside Wii Sports in the United States.
                <br><br>    
                Originally planned for release in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo so the developers could add more content and refine the game. The Wii version was released on the same day the Wii was launched, making Twilight Princess the first Zelda game to debut at the launch of a Nintendo console. The GameCube version was released in December 2006, and was the last Nintendo-published game for the console.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the sixteenth installment of the Legend of Zelda series, developed by Nintendo for the Wii. It was released on November 18 for Europe, November 20 for North America, and November 23 for Japan of 2011. The game was confirmed to be in the making as early as 2006, and basic information was provided at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2010.
                <br><br>    
                The Wii MotionPlus is heavily integrated into the gameplay, which is based on that of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, which was itself based on The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Skyward Sword utilizes graphics similar to, yet more heavily stylized than, the realistic palettes of Twilight Princess. The events of the game precede those of The Minish Cap, previously the first game in the timeline of the series.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an upcoming installment in the Legend of Zelda series in development for the Wii U[1] and Nintendo's upcoming console, codenamed NX. A bare minimum of information is currently available, and its connection to the earlier tech demo for the Wii U, if any, remains unknown. It has been stated, however, that it will not be a "traditional" Zelda title, possibly suggesting that a number of changes will be made to the series formula.
                <br><br>    
                At E3 2014, Shigeru Miyamoto reiterated his ambition to rethink traditional Zelda conventions; in order to achieve this goal, one of the problems he wants to solve is how to create a seamless open world, which may allow players to visit areas in any order, in three dimensions. In addition to revealing the new Zelda title will use a cel-shaded graphics style with proportions and effects akin to those seen in Twilight Princess, the E3 2014 trailer also depicts a massive open world and a cinematic battle between Link wielding a bow from horseback and a large golem-like creature.
                <br><br>
                In April 2016, it was announced that the game had been delayed yet again to 2017, because they were planning to make it an NX launch title as well.
